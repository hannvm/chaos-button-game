Welcome to another chaos game. Simple games that are purposefully unpleasant to play.

How To Play:
1. First of all choose how many colours to play with, or hit random number to let the computer decide.
2. Click each of the buttons to try to get the background colour of all the buttons to match your target colour.
3. When you complete it you will be rewarded with a surprise.

Also... the page background colour, button text colour, and button border randomnly change each time you click...

You can play this game at: https://hannvm.github.io/chaos-button-game/


Still to do:
- Tidy code and remove repetitions
- Update on page instructions
- Code in a prize for when the game is completed
- Potential Expansion: The option to change the number of buttons
